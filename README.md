# Machine-Learning-Basics
## IIIT A - ML - 2020

This Repo is basically setup for anyone that needs help understandig the basics of Machine Learning through Practical examples and well structured assignments. There are quite a few topics covered through the assignments, but all of them have a viable code and yes, there are different approaches but I have opted for the ones that are easiest to understand. As this is a Basic Course.
