# Logistic Regression

### For Question 1 we will focus on

1) LR with BGD, SGD, MBGD (2 features)
2) LR with BGD, SGD, MBGD (10 features)
3) Regularised Logistic Regression

### For Question 2 the data set in detail is as follows

1) **age** in year
2) **sex** - 1=male ,  0=female
3) **cp** - chest pain type
> Value 1: typical angina </br> Value 2: atypical angina </br> Value 3: non-anginal pain </br> Value 4: asymptomatic

4) **trestbps** - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5) **chol** - serum cholestoral (in mg/dl)
6) **fbs** - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7) **restecg** - resting electrocardiographic results
> Value 0: normal </br> Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) </br> Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria  

8) **thalach** - maximum heart rate achieved
9) **exang** - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10) **oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11) **slope** - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
> Value 1: upsloping </br> Value 2: flat </br> Value 3: downsloping

12) **ca** - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13) **thal** - 
> 3 = normal </br> 6 = fixed defect </br> 7 = reversable defect

14) **num** - diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
> Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing ,  no heart disease </br> Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing ,  heart disease
