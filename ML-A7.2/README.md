# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In this section, we will learn more about SVM's and more specifically the **Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)** used along with **RBF Kernel**


**Sequential minimal optimization (SMO)** is an algorithm for solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem that arises during the training of support-vector machines (SVM).

**Radial basis function kernel (RBF)** is a popular kernel function used in various kernelized learning algorithms. In particular, it is commonly used in support vector machine classification.
The RBF kernel on two samples x and x', represented as feature vectors in some input space, is defined as :
