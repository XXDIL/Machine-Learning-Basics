# Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)

Unlike the other regression models like **Linear and Logistic regression** that model p(y|x) directly from the training set and are called **Discriminative Learning Algorithms**.<br/>
In GDA we try to model p(x|y) and p(y) as oppose to p(y|x) we did earlier, itâ€™s called **Generative Learning Algorithms**.

In this section we will try to get a better understanding of this extremely useful Algorithm.

### Why though??

Anyone can build a model that uses a lot of data and then comes up with a very high accuracy rate. 

But if you have a very limited amount of data then the one that knows how to utilise the way the data is distributed will be able to build a far superior model than the novice.

### Warning

This is that kind of Algorithm that you dont see used that often, I personally prefer Logistic regression. As this has a really high error rate if used incorrectly.
