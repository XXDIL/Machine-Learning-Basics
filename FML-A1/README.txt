To run this code from start to finish you will need to run the 
file in the following order

1) python findlinks.py
2) python scrape.py

After running findlinks.py it will create a file "urls.txt" 
but i have already attached that in this zip.

Then after running "scrape.py" it will create the final resultant
csv file containing the details of each hotel ("DATA.csv")

NOTE: Do NOT delete the "countries.txt" file as it is the initiater
file containing the countries to search.
