## Intro to Data Analysis

#### This section is just to get a hands on experience on the theoretical aspect of ML.
#### The questions are mentioned below:

------

**1) Annual Revenue data for a company is given as,**

| Y | 2004 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Rev. (B Rs) | 61.2 | 58.3 | 67.1 | 69.2 | 68.9 | 83.5 | 89.1 | 80 | 92.3 | 93 | 97 |

- Draw a least square line fitting the data.
- What is the expected revenue in 2019
- Analyze expected error in predictions.

------

**2) The following table shows the final semester marks obtained by 10 students selected at random.**

| ML | 75 | 80 | 93 | 65 | 87 | 71 | 98 | 68 | 84 | 77 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| HUR | 82 | 78 | 86 | 72 | 91 | 80 | 95 | 72 | 89 | 74 |

Find least square line fitting the above data using : 

- X as independent variables (regression of Y on X)
- Y as independent variable (regression of X on Y)
- If a student receives a mark 96 in ML, what is her/his expected marks in HUR.
- If a student receives 95 in HUR. What is  her/his expected marks in ML.
- After plotting a) and b) what conclusions can you draw?

------

**3) Experimental results of pressure (P) for a given mass of gas corresponding to various values of volume (V) is given as:*8

| V | 54.3 | 61.8 | 72.4 | 88.7 | 118.6 | 194 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| P | 61.2 | 49.5 | 37.5 | 28.4 | 19.2 | 10.1 |

Assume PV<sup>n</sup>  = const  (say c)

- Find the parameters n and c
- Write the equation connecting P and V.
- Estimate the value of P when V=100

------

**4) Find the least square parabola which fits the data**

**Y = W<sub>0</sub> + W<sub>1</sub>X + W<sub>2</sub>X<sup>2</sup>**

| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Y | 2.4 | 2.1 | 3.2 | 5.6 | 9.3 | 14.6 | 21.9 |

------
