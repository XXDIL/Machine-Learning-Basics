# Naive Bayers Classifiers:

In this section I will try to implement 3 types

1) Multinomial
2) Bernoulli
3) Gaussian

These models will be implemented on the UCI Machine Learning Repository for **spam/ham messages**(Attached)

After going through the notebook you will gain enough knowledge to make you very own spam filter and will know which model to use.


**SPOILER ALERT :** MNB :laughing:
