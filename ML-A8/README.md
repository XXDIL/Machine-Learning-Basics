#### After all this time we finally made it. We are in the big boys league now! In this segment we are going to be modeling a Perceptron for the following Logical Operations.

1) AND gate
2) OR gate
3) NAND gate
4) NOR gate

#### Then using this knowlegde we will be modelling the X-NOR Gate (Back Prop)
