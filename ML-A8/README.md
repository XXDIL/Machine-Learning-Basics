# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

### The following is an example of a Perceptron

#### After all this time we finally made it. We are in the big boys league now! In this segment we are going to be modeling a Perceptron for the following Logical Operations.

1) AND gate
2) OR gate
3) NAND gate
4) NOR gate

#### Then using this knowlegde we will be modelling the 

1) X-NOR Gate (Back Prop)

The basic idea is to combine 2 or more Perceptrons to get a new function (in our case the XNOR gate)
