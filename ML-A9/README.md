# Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM)

**BAM has 3 main parts**

- Storage
- Testing
- Retrieval

**We will be focusing only on the Storage and Testing part**

### Storage
In thhis sep we calculate the W matrix.

### Testing
In this step we make sure that the inputs give the corresponding outputs.

### Limitations of BAM:

**Storage capacity of BAM:** In the BAM, stored number of associations should not be exceeded the number of neurons in the smaller layer.

**Incorrect convergence:** Always the closest association may not be produced by BAM.
